Discord Gift Code Generator


This script simply generates random discord gift codes and performs checks to validate the code

There are 2 versions of the script which are CLI and GUI version,you can use whatever version you want,both are doing the same job.
The only difference between is multicurl used in the cli version of this script so it works way too faster than the gui version.
